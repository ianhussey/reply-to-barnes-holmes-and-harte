# Reply to Barnes-Holmes & Harte (2022) 'The IRAP as a Measure of Implicit Cognition: A Case of Frankensteinâ€™s Monster'

Test the account of the history and development of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure offered by Barnes-Holmes & Harte (2022) against the published scientific record using (1) quotes from articles by Barnes-Holmes stating that the IRAP was developed and used as an implicit measure and (2) an analysis of authorship of IRAP publications that suggests that Barnes-Holmes never 'lost control' of the IRAP but remains to be the primary author of publications using the task.
